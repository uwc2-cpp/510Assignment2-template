//## Problem 2: Factorial
//Factorial : Write a function that returns the factorial of its single `int` argument. Declare the function `constexpr`.
//
//Add comments in your unit test to specify an example where the factorial result is determined at compile-time, and another where the factorial result is determined at run time.
//
//Write unit tests that verify both the compile - time and run - time usage.
