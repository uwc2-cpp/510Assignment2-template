//## Problem 1: Swap
// Write a `swap` function that _swaps_(exchanges the values of) two integers.Use `int*` as the argument types.
//
// Write a second `swap` function using a reference(i.e., `int&`) as the argument types. 
// (Note: The C++ library has a std::swap.In most situations just use the library version.But, for this homework, write your own swap).
//
// Write CppUnitLite tests to verify correct behavior of both functions.
